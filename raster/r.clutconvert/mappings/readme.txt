These files are mappings from land types as coded in the land-type maps to the corresponding radio signal attenuation for a particular radio propagation model that supports so called clutter maps (maps with land-type related signal attenuation, e.g. the hataDEM model). 

These files are only examples. You need to create your own mappings according to the available land type maps for your area and for a the radio signal frequency used.
